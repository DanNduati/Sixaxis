<h1 align=center>Sixaxis</h1>

## <b>Description</b>
Trying to build a light SDL2 controller port for the playstation3 Sixaxis controller (Dualshock3). Simple DirectMedia Layer(SDL) is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL/Direct3D/Metal/Vulkan.
Ive played around with the controller using python and pygame before. [Pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame) is based on SDL and is implemented as a mixture of Python and C so ill be trying to replicate a similar build only in a much smaller scale: just the controller function.
